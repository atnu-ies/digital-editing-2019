# Textual Editing in the Digital Age
## A 5-day training event organised by Animating Texts Newcastle University and the Institute of English Studies, University of London

Welcome to the repo for the "Textual Editing in the Digital Age" training event (1-5 April 2019) at Newcastle University.

The sessions will be convened by James Cummings (Newcastle, Text Encoding Initiative) **[JC]**, Tiago Sousa Garcia (Newcastle) **[TSG]**, and Christopher Ohge (London) **[CO]**, with guest tutors Charlotte Tupman (Exeter) **[CT]** and Francesca Benatti (Open U) **[FB]**. The training will consist of alternating lectures and practical workshop sessions on textual editing with XML technologies, including a thorough grounding in TEI as well as introductions to XPath searching and TEI publication tools. Also planned are  presentations of case studies, a visit to Newcastle Library's Special Collections (to hear about their interesting digital editing projects). There may also be unofficial social visits to the pub some evenings.

Registration is open to all students and staff, but preference will be given to MA and PhD students and early career staff from Northern England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. There will be no charge for the workshop.

**Applications for this workshop are now closed.**

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to
contact us at [animating.text@newcastle.ac.uk](mailto:animating.text@newcastle.ac.uk).

## Venue
The workshop will take place at Newcastle University, at the Armstrong Building room 2.96. A map of its location and a selection of nearby places to eat lunch is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TpqYGzLsH5wJwcvjHabIa6kWtRy_o9LL&usp=sharing).

The room is equipped with computers, so you will not need to bring laptops. (Although you may do so if you want.) Eduroam WiFi is available if you have registered for this at your home institution, we will not be providing any other WiFi accounts.

## Travel
The university provides maps and much more detailed travel information [on this page](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/who-we-are/contact/maps/).

**By car**: If you are coming by car, be aware that parking in Newcastle city centre is difficult and we recommend you secure this at your hotel. We encourage use of public transport if possible.

**By train**: If arriving by train, the venue is about a 20 minute walk from Newcastle Central Station. Taxis are available at the station. There is also a metro (‘Central’ station) at the train station from which you can go two stops to ‘Haymarket’ station which is adjacent to the University.

**By Metro**: Get off at the ‘Haymarket’ station which is adjacent to the University.

**By Air**: If you are flying, then fly to Newcastle (NCL), and take the metro directly from the airport to Haymarket station (or the station closest to your hotel).

Please remember that we are not affiliated, nor have any deal, with any of these hotels — feel free to choose your own. Anything near the city centre will be a good choice for attending the workshop.

## Food/Catering
Although we had originally intended for this training event to be catered, the popularity of it means we can no longer do so. We will provide morning and afternoon coffee/tea breaks. Our venue map also includes a list of on-campus or nearby eating establishments, however we are very close to the city centre and so there are a wide range of possibilities available.

## Library visit
On Wednesday 3 April 2019 we will have a slightly shorter afternoon coffee/tea break and proceed to Newcastle University’s Philip Robinson Library, to see a number of special collections material and hear about some of their digital editing projects.
