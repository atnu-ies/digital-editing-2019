         <p>WHETHER I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be
            held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my
            life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at
            twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to
            cry, simultaneously.</p>
         <p>In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by
            some sage women in the neighborhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months
            before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I
            was destined to be unlucky in life: and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts
            and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky
            infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a Friday night.</p>
