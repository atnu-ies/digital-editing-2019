            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>There is nothing in all this that your children will not be able to learn––if they
               want to––from books by more practiced hands.</p>
            <p>I should have guessed you to be a young man with an itch for writing, in which case I
               should have recommended you to write a thousand words a day for five years to find
               out whether you could write professionally or not.</p>
            <p>It takes as long to make a skilled writer as a skilled carpenter for a man of your
               turn of mind.</p>
            <p>I have only just returned from the continent, where I have passed 2 months out of
               reach of your MS. </p>
            <p>faithfully,</p>
            <p><name>G. Bernard Shaw</name></p>
