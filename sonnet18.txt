Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18)
William Shakespeare, 1564 - 1616

18.

Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?
Thou art more louely and more temperate:
Rough windes do shake the darling buds of Maie,
And Sommers lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heauen shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
And euery faire from faire some-time declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, vntrimm’d:

But thy eternall Sommer shall not fade,
Nor loose possession of that faire thou ow'st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternall lines to time thou grow'st,

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long liues this, and this giues life to thee,


William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. The son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, he was probably educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School in Stratford, where he learned Latin and a little Greek and read the Roman dramatists. At eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman seven or eight years his senior. Together they raised two daughters: Susanna, who was born in 1583, and Judith (whose twin brother died in boyhood), born in 1585.
